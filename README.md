# About
The 'HTW Dresden App' was a a student-initiated project that enables students of the [University of Applied Sciences Dresden](https://www.htw-dresden.de/) (HTW) to access their schedule, audit plan, grades and more easily. After some years the management of the HTW decided to continue the development of the app together with [Develappers GmbH](https://www.develappers.de/) and equalize the featureset of the the apps for iOS and Android to ensure the best user experience.
